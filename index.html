          <p> The famous "Pizza" is a typical Italian food, which has its roots in the Campania region; nevertheless, it is now well present in most of the world. It has a simple recipe, with only tomato, flour, water, yeast and all the seasoning that you want (please no pineapple!). The Pizza was first invented in 1889 when the Neapolitan chef Raffaele Esposito created the famous Margherita (tricolor) in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy</p>

          <p>The Italian food par excellence,
            pasta obtained from the grinding of wheat and essential element of the Italian diet. Its history has very ancient origins. It is difficult to establish who invented it: already known by the Greeks, it was forgotten with the fall of the Roman Empire and rediscovered thanks to the Arabs and the Chinese. It can be both dry and fresh, depending on the water content left in the dough. It has only been seasoned with tomatoes for a few centuries</p>

          <p>Tiramisu is one of the cornerstones of Italian cuisine, one of the most loved and made spoon desserts in the world. The origins of tiramisu are very uncertain and several cities claim its authorship. What we are sure of is that from 1980 onwards, the year in which this term was inserted in the Italian vocabulary, tiramisu has been a huge success! To date it is among the best known Italian words abroad.</p>
